How Does GroveX Work?
---------------------

GroveX provides your body with herbs, plant extracts, amino acids, roots, spices, minerals, and even oyster extract, among other ingredients linked to male vitality.

Some of these ingredients work by giving your body the ingredients needed to synthesize testosterone and other crucial male hormones. Other components work in more mysterious ways. Maca, for example, is known to boost sex drive and virility, although it’s not fully understood _how_ it works.

The largest ingredient in GroveX is tongkat ali. Each capsule of GroveX contains 400 mg of tongkat ali, a popular herb from Southeast Asia linked to libido, sex drive, and testosterone.

Other ingredients in GroveX, including amino acids like L-arginine, promote blood flow. They help relax blood vessels, making it easier to get and maintain an erection while improving overall sexual function.

GroveX has 17 ingredients in total, which work in different ways to promote sex drive, sexual function, and overall sexual performance.

GroveX Ingredients
------------------

GroveX contains 17 ingredients designed to help with testosterone, sex drive, and libido in multiple ways.

Here are all of the ingredients in GroveX and how they work:

*   **Tongkat Ali:** Tongkat ali is the largest ingredient in GroveX. It’s been used for centuries in traditional medicine and is particularly popular in traditional Indian medicine (Ayurveda) and traditional Chinese medicine. Many men take tongkat ali to boost testosterone and sex drive. According to the makers of GroveX, the plant can also support healthy cholesterol, promoting overall cardiovascular health.
*   **Muira Puama Powder:** A popular aphrodisiac in Brazil and other South American countries, Muira Puama has a long history of use in traditional medicine. Some even know it as Amazonian Viagra. Today, muira puama is becoming increasingly popular in the nutritional supplement community for its effects on libido, sex drive, and overall energy and vitality. A 2021 review found muira puama could help with erectile dysfunction – which is one reason people call it Amazonian Viagra.
*   **Maca:** Native to South America and the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains, maca has a long history of use in traditional Incan medicine and the natural remedies of other indigenous people. Maca, according to the makers of GroveX, “naturally boosts testosterone” while also increasing sexual appetite and relieving discomfort and aches. It’s a natural ingredient without side effects, backed by centuries of use in natural medicine.
*   **Sarsaparilla:** Sarsaparilla is the most significant ingredient in the GroveX proprietary formula. There’s more sarsaparilla in GroveX than any of the ingredients listed below. Sarsaparilla is not a single plant: it’s a group of plants native to tropical parts of the world, and there are about 350 species of sarsaparilla. Sarsaparilla is best known for being used in soft drinks, although it has recently increased in popularity in the nutritional supplement community. As WebMD explains, some of the natural molecules in sarsaparilla may help decrease pain and swelling.
*   **L-Arginine:** L-arginine is an amino acid best known for its effects on blood flow. Many people take L-arginine supplements daily for testosterone, sex drive, physical energy, and overall focus and memory. According to the makers of GroveX, they used an “organic amino acid” version of L-arginine to help circulate blood and strengthen blood vessels.
*   **Ginseng:** Ginseng has a long history of use in traditional Korean and traditional Chinese medicine, where it’s used for inflammation, sex drive, energy, and overall health and wellness. Backed by centuries of use in traditional medicine, we now know ginseng works because it’s rich with ginsenosides, or natural chemicals linked to inflammation and vitality. By taking the ginseng in GroveX daily, you could support healthy inflammation throughout your body and experience a noticeable effect on your sex drive, libido, and overall health and wellness.
*   **Pumpkin Seed Power:** Pumpkin seed powder is exactly what it sounds like when you grind or blend raw pumpkin seeds to condense their micronutrients. Pumpkin seed powder is one of the most popular nutritional supplement ingredients for prostate health, testosterone, and overall male vitality. Many men take pumpkin seed powder on its own daily for health and wellness. Although few studies have shown pumpkin seed powder directly raising testosterone, some studies have shown pumpkin seed powder can help with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and related symptoms.
*   **Oat Straw:** Oat straw extract, or Avena sativa, is believed to reduce inflammation and help with brain function and mood. It’s prized among herbalists for these effects, and many supplements use oat straws for testosterone health, libido, and overall sexual health and wellness. A 2017 study found oat straw was one of several popular Asian supplement ingredients that could help manage erectile dysfunction.
*   **Nettle:** Nettle, like other ingredients in GroveX, has a long history of use in male vitality boosters and testosterone support supplements. Also known as stinging nettle, nettle is one of several ingredients in GroveX. A 2016 study found nettle could help support hormone balance and body composition in a group of male college athletes. The study involved 20 male college athletes who took nettle or a placebo daily for six weeks, with those in the nettle group experiencing a significant improvement in anabolic hormone profiles compared to those in the placebo group.
*   **Cayenne Pepper:** Cayenne pepper is popular in weight loss aids, but it can also be found in metabolism boosters, testosterone formulas, and overall energy supplements. Surprisingly, cayenne pepper has been linked to testicle growth, higher testosterone levels, and other beneficial effects in men. The studies have mostly taken place on rats and mice – not humans. However, cayenne is known as a safe and effective metabolism booster.
*   **Astragalus:** Astragalus, also known as milkvetch or under its official name, Astragalus membranaceus, is a flowering plant used for centuries in traditional Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine. The plant is best known for its adaptogenic properties, which means it can help manage stress response and your body’s response to physical and cognitive stressors. Your body encounters stressors every day, and
*   **Catuaba Bark Powder:** Catuaba bark powder makes traditional medicine, including natural medicine, designed for sexual arousal and performance. Some also use Catuaba bark extract for memory, anxiety, and overall health and wellness. There isn’t _much_ evidence specifically linking Catuaba bark extract to testosterone. However, one recent review found Catuaba bark extract worked as a central nervous system stimulant – similar to caffeine without the side effects. That same study found Catuaba may have aphrodisiac properties and could help “combat sexual weakness.”
*   **Licorice:** Licorice is best known as a candy but has a long history of use in traditional medicine. Some use licorice to balance blood sugar and help with inflammation. However, some small studies have specifically linked licorice to testosterone production. A 2003 study, for example, found licorice maintained healthy testosterone levels. The study was specifically built in response to a previous study that found licorice _lowered_ testosterone levels in men. In a comprehensive review of licorice’s active effects, researchers found licorice had multiple phytochemicals (plant-based chemicals) linked to various health effects – from inflammation to respiratory health.
*   **Tribulus Terrestris:** Tribulus terrestris is one of the best-known ingredients for male libido and testosterone. A popular traditional medicine ingredient, tribulus terrestris, has been shown to enhance male performance in multiple trials. In a 2014 study, for example, researchers found athletes could experience a significant boost after using tribulus terrestris. Other studies have found that tribulus terrestris boosts libido without necessarily boosting testosterone. More recent studies have suggested that tribulus terrestris increases blood flow, relaxes blood vessels, and makes it easier to reverse ED.
*   **Orchid:** Orchid extract is one of the least well-known ingredients in GroveX, yet some studies have linked it to testosterone production and hormone balance. According to a 2006 study, Orchis anatolica (orchid extract) could improve reproductive function and fertility. The study took place on adult mice – not humans. However, it suggests orchid extract could help with testosterone in some small ways.
*   **Oyster Extract:** Oyster has long been known as a natural aphrodisiac. Surprisingly, recent studies have reinforced the value of oyster as an aphrodisiac: studies show oyster is rich in zinc and omega-3 fatty acids, which can help with sex drive and testosterone. Just 3oz of raw oysters contain as much as 33mg of zinc – more than 300% of your daily recommended value of the essential mineral. Both zinc and omega-3 fatty acids could contribute to libido, sexual performance, sex drive, and overall sexual function.
*   **Boron:** Boron, like zinc, is an essential mineral for male health. Many male multivitamins contain higher levels of boron specifically for its effects on male sexual health and function. A 1993 study found boron supplementation improved testosterone levels and increased lean body mass and strength in a group of male bodybuilders. Other studies have found men deficient in boron tend to have lower testosterone levels than men who get their daily recommended intake of boron.

How to Take GroveX
------------------

The manufacturer of GroveX recommends taking GroveX 30 minutes before sex for optimal results. Alternatively, you can take the supplement daily for general health and testosterone maintenance.

Other GroveX Features
---------------------

Plenty of testosterone boosters, libido boosters, and other supplements are available online today. Why pick GroveX? What makes the supplement unique?

Here are some of the unique features you get with GroveX:

*   **Plant Ingredients:** According to the official GroveX website, the formula contains all-natural plant ingredients. Although the capsule is gelatin, the manufacturer has purportedly used a plant-based version of gelatin (aside from the ordinary animal sources).
*   **Easy to Take Daily:** With GroveX, there’s no need to inject yourself with steroids, take hefty capsules, or mix complicated powders to take daily; instead, you just take one GroveX each day. The manufacturer recommends taking one capsule 30 minutes before sex for optimal effects.
*   **Stimulant-Free:** GroveX is free of stimulants, and the formula works without caffeine, artificial stimulants, or other additives. If taken before bed, it won’t make you jittery.
*   **Non-Habit Forming:** GroveX is non-habit forming, and the ingredients within the formula will not create dependency issues. You can continue to take GroveX daily without worrying about side effects or addiction.
*   **Save Thousands by Ordering Online Today:** GroveX normally retails for $235 per bottle, according to the official website.

The manufacturer has discounted the supplement’s price sharply when ordering directly through the manufacturer’s official website.
*   **Target Brown Fat for Optimal Effects:** GroveX specifically targets brown adipose tissue (BAT), a type of fat that boosts metabolism and energy. Brown fat works differently than white fat. While white fat increases the risk of disease and slows metabolism, brown fat is packed with mitochondria to boost metabolism, making it easier to lose weight. People with high levels of brown fat tend to burn significantly more calories daily than those with white fat, giving them an enormous weight loss advantage.
*   **Legal Nationwide and Available Without a Prescription:** GroveX is a supplement, and it’s as easy and legal to order as a protein powder or pre-workout supplement. While anabolic steroids and other invasive testosterone boosters are illegal, GroveX is a legal, prescription-free way to support testosterone production.
*   **17 Active Ingredients:** GroveX contains 17 active ingredients, including the most significant ingredients like tongkat ali, maca, L-arginine, and ginseng, and smaller ingredients like licorice and orchid. All components are backed by science, showing they support blood flow, libido, energy, testosterone, or other aspects of male health and wellness.
*   **Take Daily or Before Sex:** GroveX isn’t Viagra. It doesn’t immediately reverse ED before sex. Instead, you can take it 30 minutes before sex _or_ daily as a supplement. Taken before sex, the supplement could give you the confidence needed to boost bedroom performance. Taken daily, you can give your body the nutrients required to improve sexual function on your own
*   **Backed by 60-Day Moneyback Guarantee:** GroveX is a risk-free purchase. If the supplement doesn’t work for you, or if you’re unhappy, you can request a complete refund within 60 days.
